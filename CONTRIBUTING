Contributing to Varnish Cache
=============================

Varnish Cache is developed with Git hosted on our own infrastructure.

Official development tree is here:

    git://git.varnish-cache.org/varnish-cache

Patches can be sent to varnish-dev@varnish-cache.org.

There is a READ-ONLY git-mirror on Github.  Please do not send contributions
there, we need them by email to -dev@ for now.
