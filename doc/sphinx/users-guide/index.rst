%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Using Varnish
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This guide is intended for system administrators managing Varnish
Cache. The reader should know how to configure her web- or application
server and have basic knowledge of the HTTP protocol. The reader
should have Varnish Cache up and running with the default
configuration.

The guide is split into short chapters, each chapter taking on a
separate topic. Good luck.
