Welcome to the Varnish documentation!
=====================================

Introduction
------------

Varnish is a state of the art web accelerator. It has its mission in front of a
web server and cache content.

It makes your web site go faster.

We suggest you start by reading the installation guide
:ref:`install-index`. Once you have Varnish up and running go through
our tutorial - :ref:`tutorial-index`, and finally the :ref:`users_guide_index`.

If you need to look up how a specific Varnish tool works, the
:ref:`reference-index` can help you out. Changes from previous versions are in
the :ref:`whats-new-index` chapter. In closing we have :ref:`phk`, a collection
of blog posts related to Varnish and HTTP.
